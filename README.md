Proof of concept to learn more about explicit and implicit Matplotlib APIs 

# Reference documentation

> Matplotlib has two major application interfaces, or styles of using the library:
> - An explicit "Axes" interface that uses methods on a Figure or Axes object to create other Artists, and build a visualization step by step. This has also been called an "object-oriented" interface.
> - An implicit "pyplot" interface that keeps track of the last Figure and Axes created, and adds Artists to the object it thinks the user wants.
